2017.03.17 - Every journey begins with a single step.

So I made it past the first big hurdle: convincing myself that I'm serious about this and it is time to start.. Now what? What language should I go with? Do I brush up on one that I've used in the past? No, the whole point is to learn something new. What editors should I use? Where should I keep my code? What will my project be? A lot has changed in the past five years.. Ok, this is intimidating. Like a blind man at an orgy, I knew I was going to have to feel my way around.* 

Let's start with the basics. I'll need an editor. I want something lightweight. All of the kids these days seem to be using either Notepadd++ or Atom. I'll go with ++. OK, have it downloaded. Preference set, color scheme configured. Starting to feel nostalgic. This may actually be fun.

Next up, need a repo.. This one is a no-brainer, time to set up my github account. (Yes, I'm procrastinating on the most important decision: what language to use. Don't you remember? It took me two years of college before deciding on a major.. Back off, I'll get to it). I'm already familiar with github and can find my way around, but never got into the nitty gritty of it: creating a repo, branches, commits, and pull requests. Github Guides is probably one of the best product help guides out there. Less than 30 minutes and I have my account set up and a Hello World, Again repo.  Lookout, I'm back... 

But first, time for my first detour. (If you haven't figured it out already, I can be relly good at distracting myself). I've decided to keep this Doogie Howser-like journal as a form of theropy to get me through this adventure. So were should I publish it? Should I use GitHub Pages? How is that different than Gthub Wiki? What's this Jekyll engine do? Ok, back to feeling inept once again. Time to go do some reading and watch some tutorials.
