2017.03.17 - Hello, World. Again.

My journey started in 1998 as I was finishing up my sophmore year of college. I had finally decided (with a 'nudge' from my girlfriend) to get serious about college and commit to a major in Computer Information Systems. That was it, I wanted to be a programmer. Not just a programmer. I wanted to design and build systems that would change everything. It was the peak of the dotcom boom and I wanted in. 

For the next two years I was locked in: Data Structures & Algorithms, C Programming, Systems Analysis & Design, Database Administration. I was ready for the big show. After graduating the summer of 2000, I landed a job as a junior programmer for a major information provider. Early 20's, getting paid well to do what I loved. After late nights out partying, I would come into work, grab a power-aid and snacks from the pantry, put on a big-ass pair of headphones and tune the world out. Just me and my code. Life was good. 

Fast forward to today, 17 years later. The last meaningful line of code I wrote was about five years ago. Probably already deprecated and all traces of my code gone from the repository. I had naively chosen the perilous path of being a manager. Now don't get me wrong, given the choice I would do it again in a heartbeat. That path led has been rewarding adventure with all different types of challenges. But I'll save that part of the story for another day. 

There is one regret, though. I fell into the trap. I stopped writing code. That is changing today. I've decided to reconnect with my lost love (not my girlfriend from college, I ended up marrying her). I've decided to teach myself how to code again. This is my journey back. 

Hello, World. Again.
